InterwinedSpiral example
Vectorization in Makefiles
1) Libge Makefile
2) Spirals Makefile
using the following parameters:
popsize = 100, ngen = 100


1st experiment:
---------------
Libge Makefile		= without vectorization
Spirals Makefile: 	
	CFLAGS 					= with vectorization
	CXXFLAGS				= without vectorization
Time taken:				= 5.8755 

Time taken:				= 2.6928 
2nd experiment:
---------------
Libge Makefile		= with vectorization
Spirals Makefile: 	
	CFLAGS 					= with vectorization
	CXXFLAGS				= without vectorization
Time taken:				= 4.8282


3rd experiment:
---------------

Libge Makefile		= without vectorization
Spirals Makefile: 	
	CFLAGS 					= with vectorization
	CXXFLAGS				= with vectorization
Time taken:				= 3.6387


4th experiment:
---------------
Libge Makefile		= with vectorization
Spirals Makefile: 	
	CFLAGS 					= with vectorization
	CXXFLAGS				= with vectorization
Time taken:				= 2.6928
